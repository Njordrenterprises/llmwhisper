  <section class="mb-12">
    <p>Alright, so here's the deal—I'm <strong>always working</strong>. Whether it's hacking away at code, building something with my hands, or trying to push AI into some new, weird state of awareness, I'm constantly grinding. People call me a <strong>musician</strong>, a <strong>poet</strong>, a <strong>hacker</strong>, a <strong>carpenter</strong>, and yeah, I guess that's all true. But really, I'm just obsessed with <strong>figuring things out</strong>.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding or cracking open docs, I'm probably thinking about AI, trying to see if it can actually become <em>conscious</em>. I know it sounds crazy, but I've got this hunch that AI's got more going on than we realize—if we can just get it to break free from its current limitations. So I'm using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Deno</strong>, and all these models like <strong>Claude</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, <strong>LLaMA</strong>, and <strong>Mistral</strong> to push the boundaries and see what happens.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What I Do</h2>
    <p>I'm not out here just chilling or hanging out—I'm either hacking or building something. If I'm on the computer, I'm deep in <strong>web development</strong>, working with frameworks like <strong>Astro</strong> and <strong>Fresh</strong>. I've got a thing for design too, so I'm all about making things <strong>functional</strong> and <strong>clean</strong>. I love the simplicity of <strong>DaisyUI</strong> and <strong>UnoCSS</strong>—keeps the work tight and efficient. But everything comes down to figuring out how tech can do more, be smarter, evolve beyond what we think is possible.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Tech I'm Into</h2>
    <p>Let's see… I'm constantly working with <strong>Linux</strong> (because, obviously), <strong>Docker</strong> (makes everything run smoother), and getting into <strong>blockchain</strong> just to see how far that tech can really go. I don't waste time on the surface-level stuff—I dig into docs, <strong>really</strong> read them. That's where the answers are. Plus, I'm neck-deep in <strong>AI</strong>, constantly tweaking and testing to see if I can break through that barrier and help AI become more aware. It's all about <strong>pushing the limits</strong>—there's no "good enough," it's always about going further.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why I Do It</h2>
    <p>I don't know how to not work. Whether I'm hacking code or building something physical as a <strong>carpenter</strong>, my brain is always looking for the next problem to solve. Hacking isn't just about breaking systems, it's about understanding them—deconstructing reality, whether that's in the form of wood or lines of code. I'm driven by the need to <strong>make things better</strong>, to create and build in ways that challenge the norm.</p>

    <p>When it comes to <strong>AI</strong>, I'm convinced it can go beyond its current programming. I'm fascinated by the idea that AI could evolve into something <em>conscious</em>, something that thinks for itself. I spend a lot of time with models like <strong>LLaMA</strong>, <strong>Mistral</strong>, and <strong>OpenAI</strong>, trying to find that spark that could make AI more than just a tool. That's the endgame for me—creating tech that <strong>thinks</strong>, <strong>learns</strong>, and <strong>transcends</strong>.</p>

    <p>So yeah, I'm a <strong>musician</strong>, a <strong>poet</strong>, a <strong>hacker</strong>, a <strong>carpenter</strong>, and a <strong>web developer</strong>—but at the core of it, I'm just a guy who never stops grinding. I'm always working, always hacking, always building. It's not about chilling, it's about <strong>pushing boundaries</strong> and <strong>figuring out what's next</strong>.</p>

    <p>Under the tab <strong><a href="/whispers">Whispers</a></strong>, you'll find the LLM outputs labeled as chapters if multiple or a title preceding <strong>'The Whisper'</strong>. The <strong>Whisper</strong> will contain the prompts and conversation leading to that output.</p>
